  (50–100 words: what tags were new to you? two accessibility tips
 you applied)


In this lab, I learned about several HTML tags that were new to me, such as `details`/`summary`, `dl`/`dt`/`dd`, and `time`. I also practiced using `fieldset` and `legend` for grouping form elements.

For accessibility, I made sure to:
- Use `aria-labelledby` and `aria-label` to provide context for screen readers.
- Include a skip link at the top of the page to allow users to jump to the main content.

Additionally, I used semantic HTML5 elements like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, and `aside` to improve the structure and meaning of the page.
